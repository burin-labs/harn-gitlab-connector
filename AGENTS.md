# AGENTS.md

Pure-Harn connector package for GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab
Dedicated.

Shared connector authoring rules live in the Harn guide:

- [Connector authoring guide](https://github.com/burin-labs/harn/blob/main/docs/src/connectors/authoring.md)

Put shared connector guidance in the Harn guide and keep only
provider-specific notes and local hazards here.

`CLAUDE.md` points here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Provider notes

- `X-Gitlab-Token` is a plain shared secret, not an HMAC signature. Compare it with constant-time
  equality.
- Outbound auth may use OAuth2 access tokens, personal access tokens, project tokens, or group
  tokens; all are sent as bearer tokens.
- Current GitLab rate-limit headers are `RateLimit-*`, and GraphQL lives at `/api/graphql` outside
  `/api/v4`.
- Do not add compatibility shims or deprecation aliases in this nascent package; cut over directly
  when behavior changes.

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Build ambitious outcomes behind small typed interfaces; give behavior one owner
  and generate or parity-test projections instead of duplicating policy.
- Work autonomously within approved scope. Pause for destructive or production effects,
  exceptional spend, material ambiguity, or new authority.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, pivot, and steer as control events.
- Use the smallest owning product-path check. Add a falsifier for contested, load-bearing,
  or potentially vacuous claims; record controls, recovery, and blind spots.
- Evidence follows source/artifact identity. Reuse proof when relevant code, build inputs,
  and dependencies are unchanged. Repeat affected checks for relevant changes, failures,
  deployment, or packaging differences. Do not rebuild or recapture solely for main.
- Ship means owning-main integration with terminal merge and applicable release/deploy
  checks. Confirm landed content and result; an open PR is incomplete.
- Use `ship` with a deployed Smart Ship caller; otherwise use `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
  Never use `--admin`; incidents use `bypass-ci`, `bypass-merge-queue`, or `force-merge`.
